We're excited to announce that BTCO.VC has been selected to join the inaugural Beta Cohort at DIF Labs, the innovation arm of the Decentralized Identity Foundation. This marks a significant milestone in our mission to bring standardized verifiable credentials to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Why DIF Labs?

DIF Labs represents a new chapter in the decentralized identity space, focusing on practical innovation and market-ready solutions. As part of their first Beta Cohort, BTCO.VC will work alongside industry experts to develop and refine our specifications for Bitcoin-based verifiable credentials.

## Our Focus During the Program

During our time at DIF Labs (November 2024 - February 2025), we'll be focusing on three key areas:

- Developing comprehensive technical specifications for Bitcoin Ordinals-based verifiable credentials, with a particular emphasis on DID Linked Resources to enable universal resolution of credentials through Bitcoin-native DIDs
- Updating the `did:btco` method specification, which leverages Bitcoin's native capabilities for secure identifier creation and management
- Ensuring alignment with W3C standards while leveraging Bitcoin's unique capabilities

The integration of DID Linked Resources represents a significant innovation in our approach. By linking credentials to Bitcoin-native DIDs (which are tied to specific satoshis), we can:

- Enable universal resolution of verifiable credentials through the Bitcoin network
- Create a direct connection between Bitcoin's native assets (satoshis) and decentralized identifiers
- Leverage Bitcoin's security model while ensuring seamless interoperability with existing DID systems
- Transform verifiable credentials into tradeable digital assets while maintaining their verifiability

This approach allows us to create a truly Bitcoin-native verifiable asset layer where assets can be universally resolved through DIDs that are intrinsically linked to Bitcoin's fundamental unit - the satoshi.

## What This Means for BTCO.VC

Being part of DIF Labs provides us with invaluable resources and opportunities:

- Direct access to technical expertise in decentralized identity systems
- Collaborative environment with other innovative projects
- Structured approach to specification development
- Industry connections and feedback channels

## Looking Ahead

Our participation in DIF Labs is just the beginning. Following the specification phase, we'll move into implementation and testing, working towards our goal of providing a robust, standardized framework for verifiable credentials on Bitcoin.

## Get Involved

We believe in building in the open and welcome community participation. You can follow our progress and contribute in several ways:

- Star and watch our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/labs-ordinals-plus)
- Join the discussions in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/labs-ordinals-plus/discussions)
