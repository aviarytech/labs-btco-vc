## Abstract

The BTC Ordinals DID Linked Resources extension provides a standardized framework for associating immutable [[ref: DID Linked Resource]]s with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) anchored in the Bitcoin blockchain through ordinal inscriptions. This specification introduces mechanisms for creating, managing, and referencing linked resources, enabling organizations and individuals to attach verifiable credential schemas, governance frameworks, logos, status lists, and other resource types to their DIDs. The extension ensures the authenticity, integrity, and traceability of resources while maintaining compatibility with W3C DID Core standards and interoperability with existing BTC Ordinals inscriptions. The specification addresses key challenges such as [[ref: Resource Resolution]], resource discovery, and version management, providing a robust foundation for secure and scalable applications in decentralized identity ecosystems.
