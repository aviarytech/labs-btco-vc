## Abstract

The BTCO DID Linked Resources extension provides a standardized framework for associating immutable [[ref: DID Linked Resources]] with [[ref: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)]] anchored in the [[ref: Bitcoin (BTC)]] blockchain through [[ref: Ordinal Theory]] and [[ref: Inscriptions]]. This specification introduces mechanisms for creating, managing, and referencing resources, enabling organizations and individuals to attach verifiable credential schemas, governance frameworks, logos, status lists, and other resource types to their DIDs. The extension ensures the authenticity, integrity, and traceability of resources while maintaining compatibility with W3C DID Core standards and interoperability with existing resources on BTC. The specification addresses key challenges such as [[ref: Resource Resolution]], resource discovery, and version management, providing a robust foundation for secure and enduring applications in decentralized identity ecosystems.
