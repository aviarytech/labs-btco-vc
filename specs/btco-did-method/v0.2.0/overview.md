## Overview

The BTCO DID Method combines the security of the Bitcoin blockchain with ordinal theory to create a decentralized identity management system. Key features include:

* Zero counterparty risk through direct Bitcoin blockchain usage
* Leveraging Bitcoin's network effects and security
* Supporting standard DID operations through ordinal inscriptions
* Full compliance with W3C DID Core Specification

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this method is to:
- Provide a secure and decentralized identity solution without relying on additional networks
- Enable verifiable credential issuance and verification
- Support digital identity management directly on Bitcoin
- Leverage Bitcoin's immutability for identity persistence

### Key Features

1. **Native Bitcoin Integration**: Direct use of Bitcoin's blockchain without additional layers
2. **Ordinal-based Identity**: Utilizing ordinal theory for unique identity assignment
3. **Standard Compliance**: Full W3C DID Core specification compatibility
4. **Flexible Key Management**: Support for various cryptographic algorithms
5. **Resource Linking**: Integration with BTCO DID Linked Resources specification
